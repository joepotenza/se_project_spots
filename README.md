# Spots: A Photo Sharing App

This project is similar in functionality to popular social media photo sharing platforms. The main page is a typical user profile, with an avatar, short bio, and a grid of photographs with titles. There are (currently non-functional) buttons for editing the bio, adding a new post, and liking the photos.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox and grid layout
- Responsive design
- BEM flat file structure and naming conventions

The project can be previewed on Github Pages, located at [https://joepotenza.github.io/se_project_spots](https://joepotenza.github.io/se_project_spots).
